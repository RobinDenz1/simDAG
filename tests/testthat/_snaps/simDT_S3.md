# print.simDT, save_states='all'

    A simDT object with:
      -  15  observations
      -  50  distinct points in time
      -  3  time-varying variables in total
      -  3  time_to_event nodes
      -  0  competing_events nodes
    States of the simulation were saved at all points in time. 

# print.simDT, save_states='last'

    A simDT object with:
      -  15  observations
      -  50  distinct points in time
      -  3  time-varying variables in total
      -  3  time_to_event nodes
      -  0  competing_events nodes
    Only the last state of the simulation was saved. 

# print.simDT, save_states='at_t'

    A simDT object with:
      -  15  observations
      -  50  distinct points in time
      -  3  time-varying variables in total
      -  3  time_to_event nodes
      -  0  competing_events nodes
    States of the simulation were saved at user-defined points in time.
