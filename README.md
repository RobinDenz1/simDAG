# simDAG <img src="man/figures/logo.png" height="240" align="right" />

Author: Robin Denz

## Description

`simDAG` is an R-Package which can be used to generate data from a known directed acyclic graph (DAG) with associated information
on distributions and causal coefficients. The root nodes are sampled first and each subsequent child node is generated according to a
regression model (linear, logistic, multinomial, cox, ...) or other function. The result is a dataset that has the same causal structure as the
specified DAG and by expectation the same distributions and coefficients as initially specified. It also implements a
comprehensive framework for conducting discrete-time simulations in a similar fashion.

## Installation

Currently this package is not available on CRAN, but can be installed easily using the `remotes` R-Package:

```R
library(remotes)

remotes::install_github("RobinDenz1/simDAG")
```

## Bug Reports and Feature Requests

If you encounter any bugs or have any specific feature requests, please file an [Issue](https://github.com/RobinDenz1/simDAG/issues).

## Examples

Suppose we want to generate data with the following causal structure:

<p align="center">
	<img src="man/figures/example_DAG.png" width="450" />
</p>

where `age` is normally distributed with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 4 and `sex` is bernoulli distributed with `p = 0.5` (equal number of men and women).
Both of these "root nodes" (meaning they have no parents - no arrows pointing into them) have a direct causal effect on the `bmi`.
The causal coefficients are 1.1 and 0.4 respectively, with an intercept of 12 and a sigma standard deviation of 2. `death` is modeled as a bernoulli variable, which is
caused by both `age` and `bmi` with causal coefficients of 0.1 and 0.3 respectively. As intercept we use -15.

The following code can be used to generate 10000 samples from these specifications:

```R
dag <- empty_dag() +
  node("age", type="rnorm", mean=50, sd=4) +
  node("sex", type="rbernoulli", p=0.5) +
  node("bmi", type="gaussian", parents=c("age", "sex"), betas=c(1.1, 0.4),
    intercept=12, error=2) +
  node("death", type="binomial", parents=c("age", "bmi"), betas=c(0.1, 0.3),
    intercept=-15)

sim_dat <- sim_from_dag(dag, n_sim=10000)
```

By fitting appropriate regression models, we can check if the data really does approximately conform to our specifications.
First, lets look at the `bmi`:

```R
mod_bmi <- glm(bmi ~ age + sex, data=sim_dat, family="gaussian")
summary(mod_bmi)
```

This seems about right. Now we look at `death`:

```R
mod_death <- glm(death ~ age + bmi, data=sim_dat, family="binomial")
summary(mod_death)
```

The estimated coefficients are also very close to the ones we specified. More examples can be found in the documentation and the vignette.
