####### New Features: #######

sim_discrete_time:
	- maybe include t = 0 in output (or an option for it)?
	- allow all nodes to be based on previous t in one argument
	- either allow root nodes with supplied t0_data, or throw warning if still supplied

node_next_time:
	- allow parametric survival models in "model" if rsurv package is updated
	- maybe allow "delays"?

dag_from_data:
	- should allow multinomial
	- should allow formula input with interactions / non-linear terms etc.
	- should allow time-dependent nodes
		-> if time-dependent nodes are allowed, it could be used to apply the parametric g-formula
		-> write vignette about that

node_competing_events:
	- allow vector input in immunity_duration: this would require me to augment
	  the probability matrix, because then other events would still be possible
	- allow stuff like time_since_last / event_count
	- add unif argument as in node_time_to_event()
	
sim2start_stop:
	- add support for competing event nodes
		- event_durations vector on line 101 needs to be changed to allow different event_durations per different event
		- the data.table on line 126 needs to include another column including the event type (cause)
		- probably need to change the dcast() call accordingly on line 133
		- instead of returning the condition directly on line 149/150, it should return the corresponding event
