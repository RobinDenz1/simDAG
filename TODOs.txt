General Stuff:
	- finish vignettes
	- add pkgdown site, badges etc.
	- create a package logo
	- update README

sim_from_dag:
	- allow categorical data to be parents of other nodes
	- finish tests and checks
	- implement more node types:
		- other types of survival regression
		- ordinal regression
		- allow different link functions in binomial / gaussian
		- whatever models one can find may be nice

nodes_from_data:
	- should also allow more node types
	- needs tests
	- needs examples
	- needs input checks
	- maybe a different kind of input? just a DAG and node type list

plot_dag:
	- would be nice if it had at least some options and was a little prettier
	- needs tests
	- needs only limited input checks

node_time_to_event:
	- find a better way to store past_event_times. In theory a hash table
	  should be the best option here but I couldn't make it work well
	- anything that makes this function faster would be awesome

node_competing_events:
	- allow vector input in immunity_duration: this would require me to augment
	  the probability matrix, because then other events would still be possible
	- add tests
	- add input checks (could probably use most of the checks for node_time_to_event)
	- has the same "event-storage" problem as the node_time_to_event function
	
sim_discrete_time:
	- make this function faster

sim2long:
	- should work with save_states="at_t" as well
	- the code for creating it based on save_states="last" is very inefficient and should be improved
	- should contain support for competing event nodes

sim2start_stop:
	- currently only based on sim2long, which is RAM inefficient if save_states="last" was used,
	  should contain support for directly using the last state to build the start-stop data somehow
	- should contain support for competing event nodes

NEW needed functions:
	- a function that automatically plots a flow chart for the sim_discrete_time function based on the
	  node information would also be great
