General Stuff:
	- add pkgdown site, badges etc.

###### Bugs & TODOS ######

sim2start_stop:
	- .last works now, but adds unneccessary columns if events of the same kind happen right after one another

plot.simDT:
	- bug when changing box_r_width and box_hdist at the same time

####### New Features: #######

sim_from_dag:
	- implement more node types:
		- other types of survival regression
		- ordinal regression
		- allow different link functions in binomial / gaussian
		- whatever models one can find may be nice

dag_from_data:
	- should also allow more node types

node_competing_events:
	- allow vector input in immunity_duration: this would require me to augment
	  the probability matrix, because then other events would still be possible
	- allow stuff like time_since_last / event_count
	
sim2start_stop:
	- add support for competing event nodes
		- event_durations vector on line 101 needs to be changed to allow different event_durations per different event
		- the data.table on line 126 needs to include another column including the event type (cause)
		- probably need to change the dcast() call accordingly on line 133
		- instead of returning the condition directly on line 149/150, it should return the corresponding event
