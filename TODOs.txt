###### Bugs & TODOS ######



###### For the Review #####

- enhance plot.DAG() to show different relationship strengths
- allow function to generate DAG in sim_n_datasets()
- finish cookbook vignette
- implement random intercepts / random slope support

# Changes in the manuscript

- better explanation of sim_discrete_time()
- mention dag_from_data()
- explain event order thing
- write more explictly that the package is not mainly about data synthesis in discussion
- check that i followed all the journal style stuff

####### New Features: #######

sim_discrete_time:
	- maybe include t = 0 in output (or an option for it)?

sim_from_dag:
	- implement more node types:
		- other types of survival regression
		- ordinal regression
		- allow different link functions in binomial / gaussian
		- whatever models one can find may be nice

dag_from_data:
	- should allow multinomial

node_competing_events:
	- allow vector input in immunity_duration: this would require me to augment
	  the probability matrix, because then other events would still be possible
	- allow stuff like time_since_last / event_count
	
sim2start_stop:
	- add support for competing event nodes
		- event_durations vector on line 101 needs to be changed to allow different event_durations per different event
		- the data.table on line 126 needs to include another column including the event type (cause)
		- probably need to change the dcast() call accordingly on line 133
		- instead of returning the condition directly on line 149/150, it should return the corresponding event
