General Stuff:
	- finish vignettes
	- perform build checks and bring package in order
	- add pkgdown site, badges etc.
	- create a package logo
	- update README

sim_from_dag:
	- allow categorical data to be parents of other nodes
	- finish tests and checks
	- implement more node types:
		- negative binomial regression
		- other types of survival regression
		- ordinal regression
		- allow different link functions in binomial / gaussian
		- whatever models one can find may be nice

nodes_from_data:
	- should also allow more node types
	- needs tests
	- needs examples
	- needs input checks
	- maybe a different kind of input? just a DAG and node type list

plot_dag:
	- would be nice if it had at least some options and was a little prettier
	- needs tests
	- needs only limited input checks

node_time_to_event:
	- allow multiple competing event types, by using a multinomial trial
	  instead of bernoulli trials at each step (see rcategorical)
	- find a better way to store past_event_times. In theory a hash table
	  should be the best option here but I couldn't make it work well
	- anything that makes this function faster would be awesome
	
sim_discrete_time:
	- make this function faster

NEW needed functions:
	- currently the sim_discrete_time function spits out data that is pretty much unusable.
	  needs some function that automatically transforms the data into
	  a useful format, such as start, stop data or the wide format etc.
	- a function that automatically plots a flow chart for the sim_discrete_time function based on the
	  node information would also be great
