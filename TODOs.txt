General Stuff:
	- finish & update vignettes
	- add pkgdown site, badges etc.

sim_from_dag:
	- allow categorical data to be parents of other nodes
	- implement more node types:
		- other types of survival regression
		- ordinal regression
		- allow different link functions in binomial / gaussian
		- whatever models one can find may be nice

dag_from_data:
	- should also allow more node types

node_time_to_event:
	- maybe change immunity_duration parameter to start counting after event stops
	- maybe make time_since_last columns -1 if event hasn't happened yet instead of NA?

node_competing_events:
	- allow vector input in immunity_duration: this would require me to augment
	  the probability matrix, because then other events would still be possible
	- add tests
	- add input checks (could probably use most of the checks for node_time_to_event)
	- allow user access to past_event_times and past_event_causes list

sim2start_stop:
	- add support for competing event nodes
	- possible bug if columns are named "start" or "stop"
	- .last works now, but adds unneccessary columns if events of the same kind happen right after one another

plot.simDT
	- bug when changing box_r_width and box_hdist at the same time
	- in general, many of the parameters use odd definitions (box_hdist counting from middle to middle, regardless of box_width etc.)
	  may need some change to make it easier to specify them
