###### Bugs & TODOS ######

tests on parallel processing:
	- check if those work again now

network() and network_td()
	- finish new vignette on network simulation
	- network() in sim_from_dag() currently not allowed to be data dependent
	- currently, networks are always initiated at the same time, irrespective
      of position in DAG creation, need to change this
	- error when net() call is a root node with no previously generated variables

####### New Features: #######

node_time_to_event:
	- add support for formula (interpreted as logistic model) to make some
	  model formulations more convenient

sim_discrete_time:
	- maybe include t = 0 in output (or an option for it)?

sim_from_dag:
	- implement more node types:
		- ordinal regression
		- whatever models one can find may be nice

dag_from_data:
	- should allow multinomial
	- should allow formula input with interactions / non-linear terms etc.

node_competing_events:
	- allow vector input in immunity_duration: this would require me to augment
	  the probability matrix, because then other events would still be possible
	- allow stuff like time_since_last / event_count
	
sim2start_stop:
	- add support for competing event nodes
		- event_durations vector on line 101 needs to be changed to allow different event_durations per different event
		- the data.table on line 126 needs to include another column including the event type (cause)
		- probably need to change the dcast() call accordingly on line 133
		- instead of returning the condition directly on line 149/150, it should return the corresponding event
