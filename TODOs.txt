General Stuff:
	- add pkgdown site, badges etc.

###### Bugs & TODOS ######

node_negative_binomial:
	- I think it's not working correctly yet

sim2start_stop:
	- .last works now, but adds unneccessary columns if events of the same kind happen right after one another

plot.simDT
	- bug when changing box_r_width and box_hdist at the same time


####### New Features: #######

sim_from_dag:
	- implement more node types:
		- other types of survival regression
		- ordinal regression
		- allow different link functions in binomial / gaussian
		- whatever models one can find may be nice

dag_from_data:
	- should also allow more node types

node_competing_events:
	- allow vector input in immunity_duration: this would require me to augment
	  the probability matrix, because then other events would still be possible
	- allow stuff like time_since_last / event_count
	
sim2start_stop:
	- add support for competing event nodes
